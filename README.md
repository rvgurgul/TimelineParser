# TimelineParser
With the json-timelines parsed by Calvin's Triple Agent Project, I have constructed my own tools to parse statistics from the game timelines available in json format. 

Calvin's project can be found here: https://github.com/andrewzwicky/TripleAgent

My currently implemented (and planned) statistics can be viewed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FrxRZ6fLqjz4CFjyEzfkkG4cqvMcatkQFMytYwBy9Rs/edit?usp=sharing
